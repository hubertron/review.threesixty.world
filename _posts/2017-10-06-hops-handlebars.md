This is quite a lot here. It tells a brief "story" from getting to the resort, taking the lift up, to watching some competition and then headed back down the mountain to derailer bar. It's long, but it plays pretty well in my opinion but is likely too long for the event.

Thoughts for next step include:

* Separating the bike action from the ambient, so just having the golf, lift, pond, bar on one clip and then adding the bike stuff separately.
* Separate bike competition from downhill, from ambient and have 3 different clips


Still to do once we get a edit locked:

* Transitions between clips
* Image stabilization
* removing the tripod from the video footage
* color correct
